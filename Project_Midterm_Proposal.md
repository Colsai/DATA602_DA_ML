# Homework - Week 7 - Draft Outline for Project ProposalHomework - Week 7 - Draft Outline for Project Proposal
Please craft an outline/draft of your proposed project. Please feel free to use the format that represents your thoughts and ideas.A few PowerPoint slides would be helpful - so you can present to the class on Tuesday  10/19. However, the format is your choice - a MSWord document that represents a 'paper' outline is OK , as well. Overall it should include:

## - Topic/Title - 
- High-level overview - ideally should become the basis of your abstract for the final project paper at the end of the course
- Motivation - why or what is interesting or fascinating about the project; initial hypothesis.
- Datasets - what is the dataset you need or plan to use. Is it easily available OR are you still looking for data. Are there challenges to getting the data. Any limitations in terms of size that you anticipate - over-sized or under-sized dataset? 
- Any pre-processing of data required? Cleansing, dropping, quality checks needed?
- Overall flow/logic of the analyis. ( need not be technical ; the model etc. can be specified in a seperate section, if needed).
- Technical Description : Model, Methods to be used ( e.g. Regressiion, Classification, Clustering or combination). Training/test/validation data split; Any cross-validation required? 
- Proposed accuracy metrics, errors to be validated/verfied
- Anticipated conclusion - validation of hypothesis
- References to sample code available in the public domain like github links, books, articles . Please list potential code references, snippets that you are considering to adapt, retroft or think are good references foryou to work on.
Any other thoughts - e.g. impediments, challenges, concerns , OR benefits etc. 
We will discuss and think aloud in the class and use this as a basis for the mid-term exam submission. Since this is a draft, it's OK if you include some of the points lists above and drop some or include some minimalist verbiage around above. The list above is intended to enable you to structure your ideas and thoughts.
